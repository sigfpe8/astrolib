I'm reading the book `Celestial Calculations` by J. L. Lawrence (MIT Press, 2018) and, as learning exercise, I'm trying to implement the algorithms presented there in Zig. Although the author implemented the functions grouped by chapter, I want to create a library that can be used by other programs. There are many test files (I prefer them separate from the main implementation) but there's one especially dedicated to solving the exercises presented in the book. This is the first edition of this book and as such it contains several errors that can confuse you along the way. Fortunately there is an online errata to help readers and implementers keep their sanity.

Not for serious use, just for learning and entertaining. And, as all of my repositories on github, a continuos work in progress.
